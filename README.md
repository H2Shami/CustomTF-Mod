# CustomTF-Mod
My modifications to the popular Quake mod CustomTF

In CustomTF, the standard grappling hook takes you from point A to point B in a linear fashion, which is kinda lame
I changed the grappling hook so it creates an arc with a rope that doesn't change its radius to simulate a real rope
You can swing off the rope, reel people in, zip to the ground, and climb up the rope
